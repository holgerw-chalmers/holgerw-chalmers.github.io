{% include base_path %}

The PROCEL project aims at building up knowledge about the opportunities to shift towards carbon-free industrial processes through increased electrification. Technical, economical and emissions related implications of the introduction of a variety of techniques will be examined. Furthermore, possible strategic and political implications of increased electrification of industrial processes will be analyzed.
