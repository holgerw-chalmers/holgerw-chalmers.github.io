PROCEL project description
======
The project aims at building up knowledge about the opportunities to shift towards carbon-free industrial processes through increased electrification. Technical, economical and emissions related implications of the introduction of a variety of techniques will be examined. Furthermore, possible strategic and political implications of increased electrification of industrial processes will be analyzed. The Energy Agency considers the project's potential contribution to the energy transition as significant.
