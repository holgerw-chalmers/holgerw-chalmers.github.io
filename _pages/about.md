I am a PhD student in Industrial Energy Systems at [Chalmers University in Gothenburg](https://www.chalmers.se) (Sweden) in the Division of Energy Technology since February 2017. Before, that I obtained a masters degree in "Sustainable Energy Systems" and worked as portfolio manager for renewable electricity.

My Research Focus: Electrification of Industrial Processes
======
My research focusses on the electrification of industrial processes to promote the decarbonisation of the industrial sector. The objective is to enhance the knowledge on process electrification technologies including techno-economic and environmental assessments under possible future energy market conditions. This will also allow to compare electrification with other decarbonisation options. My correspondent research project is [PROCEL](https://holgerw-chalmers.github.io/procel/).

Research Network on Industrial Decarbonisation (RENEW-Industry)
======
I am co-founder of the Research Network on Industrial Decarbonisation (RENEW-Industry) which is a network for scientific researchers in academia and research institutes that focus on Industrial Decarbonisation.
